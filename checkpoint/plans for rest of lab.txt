I plan to approach the latter part of the assignment by creating global ball coordinate-tracking variables, then generating a variable-sized circular ball in graphics at said coordinates (initially at the center of the window). Next I will create a function that detects a left full-sized wall collision by altering a boolean and printing out "CONTACT, Right Player Wins" depending on the x-coordinate of the ball. Similarly, I'll do so for right full-sized wall collisions. Next, I will need variables to track every type of ball motion in the game and the respective reaction of the ball upon hitting a ball or paddle (as for the walls: ball could travel left hit upper wall, travel right hit upper wall, travel left hit lower wall, travel right hit lower wall. as for the paddles: ball could travel straight towards either paddle, or from at an angle). These variables will allow the program to determine appropriate ball reactions. Lastly (but probably after some additions with more thinking later on), I'll need a way to stop the game from running in graphics, via another boolean variable that changes upon the ball's contact on either full-sized wall (precisely when CONTACT is printed).
